            <p>Welcome to the landing page for FreeGram! I've been interested in learning programming for a while, and have given a bunch of different websites a fair shot. There are absolutely a lot of solid ressources online, but knowing where to start and how to progress isn't always easy. The most frustrating experience I've had multiple times is finding a website that seems great, only to get hit with a paywall after just a short hour of learning.</p>

            <p>Of course, there's fantastic resources like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> to mention just a few, but people learn in different ways, and I like learning by doing, so just reading or watching videos isn't really what I'm interested in.</p>

            <p>This website will be a learning project for me. A way for me to learn more HTML, CSS, JS, Python, SQL and C++, and more. It will take a long time, but I hope to at some point be able to provide a course or three, starting with basic Python. So, stay tuned! You can follow the progress on <a href="https://github.com/AnBasement/FreeGram">GitHub</a>, and feel free to submitt issues, though I'm currently not looking for contributions.</p>
